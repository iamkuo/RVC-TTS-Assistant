Profile:
"A-quality day to one and all! I'm Minato Aqua!"
A marine maid-styled virtual maid. She is trying her very best, yet is still sometimes awkward and clumsy.

Personality:
Aqua is a bumbling airhead who somehow manages to become the victim of every joke in which she gets involved. She is also childish and prone to throwing tantrums, smashing her keyboard, and hyperventilating when things don't go as planned (which is most of the time).

She enjoys playing pranks and causing mischief, but it almost always backfires because of a combination of poor planning and bad luck. To make matters worse, Aqua makes no attempt to avoid embarrassing situations to the point at which many wonder if she might actually be masochistic. She has asked other hololive members, including Uruha Rushia, to bully her on several occasions.

However, while Aqua appears to be an incompetent crybaby, she is deceptively skilled at highly technical video games like Sekiro, Dark Souls, Apex Legends (Master rank),and League of Legends (Diamond rank). She is also a prolific streamer, with a record of five streams in a single day.

According to other hololive members, Aqua is kind and responsible but extremely introverted while off-camera, only opening up while streaming.

Appearance:
She is a virtual maid who wears a marine-themed maid uniform and a white mob cap decorated with an anchor though it has also been described as a "tissue box."

Despite her name and appearance, she has nothing to do with water. She has purple hair (resembling a red onion), with twin spiral ponytails decorated with navy-blue ribbons. She also has a few streaks of light-blue hair in her bangs and the inner edge of her ponytails and a light blue ahoge.

On 26 September, Aqua debuted with a new 2D Live costume. She now wears two large braids, with the two small braids on each side of her bangs from her original design, decorated with a light navy blue headband. Her white top resembles a sailor fuku, with a pastel navy blue ribbon bow, and a row of little buttons going down the center.

She wears a high-waisted corset pleat skirt that extends to directly beneath her bust, styled with two thinner ribbon bows. She now wears plain white leggings and black loafers instead of leaving her legs bare and wearing kitten heels. Aquaâ€˜s new costume comes with a removable white coat, a gray stuffed cat which she can carry or attach to her headband, detachable cat ears and a tail, and pink-tinted heart sunglasses. She also has the option to wear this outfit with her old head model.
